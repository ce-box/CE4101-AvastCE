Simple example of an application of the strategy design pattern, we implement an "antivirus" ðŸ›¡

## Strategy Design Pattern 

### Problem ðŸ“›

One of the dominant strategies of object-oriented design is the "open-closed principle".

Figure demonstrates how this is routinely achieved - encapsulate interface details in a base class, and bury implementation details in derived classes. Clients can then couple themselves to an interface, and not have to experience the upheaval associated with change: no impact when the number of derived classes changes, and no impact when the implementation of a derived class changes.

### Structure ðŸ§© 

The **Interface** entity could represent either an **abstract base class**, or the method signature expectations by the client. In the former case, the **inheritance hierarchy represents dynamic polymorphism**. In the latter case, the Interface entity represents template code in the client and the inheritance hierarchy represents static polymorphism.

## Example

### AvastCE ðŸ›¡

For the example of this tutorial we will make a mock of an antivirus. **AvastCE antivirus** has many types of scans: quick scan, deep scan, file scan and others.
Not all scans can be run in the free version, for deep scans you must have a pro account.
We will use the Strategy pattern to implement the different types of scans that can be run.
